SCRIPT INFO

1. mapping_scecap_stations
Generates map of all SCECAP stations using ggplot2 and ggmap. 

2. rarefaction
Uses rarefaction to estimate species richness of all SCECAP stations based on the number of individuals caught. 

3. site_summaries
Provides general summaries of SCECAP trawl data such as total number of stations visited, overall species richness, average abundance, etc. Outputs a summary table.

4. species_accumulation_years
Uses species accumulation curves to show changes in species richness over time. This technique allows for the comparison of species richness across years with different numbers of stations.

5. species_area_relationships
Examines the relationship between trawl distances and species richness/abundance. 

6. yearly_site_richness_abund_avgs
This script calculates the average richness/abundance per station per year. It then plots these averages over time.
