CCAP LandCover Metadata

BACKGROUND

NOAA's C-CAP (coastal change and analysis program) offers a Land cover dataset developed for the coastal US based on landsat imagery. This dataset is released every 5 years (data for 2015 still pending) and includes 21 land cover categories at a resolution of 30x30m. Landcover data analyzed by HUC watershed for coastal SC using ArcMap 10.3's 'Tabulate Area' tool. 


CONTENTS

UPLAND: Upland category in which percent land cover values were calculated. Upland 0 = entire watershed, upland 1 = watershed minus open water, upland 2 = watershed minus open water, palustrine/estuarine emergent wetlands, and unconsolidated shore. 
HUC_ID: USGS Hydrologic Unit Code watershed identifier
HUC_DIGITS: number of digits in HUC. 8-digit HUCs are the largest watershed used in this project and 14-digit HUCs are the smallest.
YEAR: year in which the C-CAP land cover data was published (1995, 2001, 2006, 2010)
prct_******: percent of each landcover category within each watershed. 
	HIGHDEV: high-intensity development
	MEDDEV: medium-intensity development
	LOWDEV: low-intensity development
	OPEDEV: open-space developement
	CULLAN: cultivated land
	PASHAY: pasture/hay
	GRASSL: grassland
	DECFOR: deciduous forest
	EVEFOR: evergreen forest
	MIXFOR: mixed forest
	SCRSHR: scrub/shrub
	PALFORWET: palustrine forested wetland
	PALSCRWET: palustrine scrub/shrub wetland
	PALEMEWET: palustrine emergent wetland
	ESTFORWET: estuarine forested wetland
	ESTSCRWET: esturaine scrub/shrub wetland
	ESTEMEWET: estuarine emergent wetland
	UNCSHO: unconsolidated shore
	BARLAN: bareland
	WAT: open water
	PALAQUBED: palustrine aquatic bed
