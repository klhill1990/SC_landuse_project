1. About SCECAP
SCECAP, South Carolina Estuarine and Coastal Assessment Program, is a envioronmental monitoring program established by the state's department of natural resources. It has been surveying tidal creeks and estuaries along the entire SC coast since 1999. Data collected from this program includes water quality, bacterial contamination, organic and heavy metal pollutants, and biodiversity. More information on SCECAP can be found at "http://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/scecap/".

2. About Trawl Data
The focus of this GitHub project is to evaluate SCECAP's trawl data to explore patterns in estuarine biodiversity over space and time. Trawling is a technique where a net is dragged behind a boat to sample species from the water column. The catch is brought on board, identified down to the species level, and counted before being returned to the water. These data include number of individuals (abundance) and a species identifier (species code). Most species are fish, however crustaceans are also captured and documented. 

3. Scripts
Contained in this repository are several scripts written in R to manipulate and visualize the SCECAP trawl data. The two biodiversity metrics used in these analyses are species richness and abundance. Species richness is the number of different species sampled, whereas abundance is the total number of individuals caught. 

4. Output
The output folder contains tables, graphs, and maps created by the scripts. Some of these figures include the change in species richness over time and a map of all the SCECAP stations.
