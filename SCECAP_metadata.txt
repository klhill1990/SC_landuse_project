SCECAP Metadata

BACKGROUND

Environmental data from SC Department of Natural Resources' (SCDNR) South Carolina Estuarine and Coastal Assessment Program (SCECAP). This dataset represents a total of 767 sampling locations along the SC coast and covers a time period from 1999 to 2017. 

CONTENTS
 
STATION_ID: unique station code
DATE: date when sites were sampled
STATION_TYPE: 'OpenWater' or 'TidalCreek.' Tidal creeks sites are between 10 and 100 meters wide, and open water sites are >100m and represent larger tidal creeks, rivers, bays, and sounds. No sites are placed in the open ocean.
StationLat and StationLon: coordinates (decimal degrees) of site
HUC_08, HUC_10, HUC_12, HUC_14: USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watersheds in which sites are located. More digits (14) are smaller watersheds.
BIBI_CP: Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI). Score 1-5 represents health of benthic communities. Higher BIBI's contain higher abundances of stress sensitive benthic taxa.
ERMQ: Effects Range Median Quotient is a measure of sediment toxicity, and estimates the biological effect of 24 contaminant (higher scores represent worse conditions). 
ERMQ_Metals: ERMQ score based on heavy metal pollutants
ERMQ_PAH: ERMQ score based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
ERMQ_PCB: ERMQ score based on polychlorinated biphenyls
ERMQ_Pest: ERMQ score based on pesticides.

SiltClay:
TOC_sediment: total organic carbon in sediment
Entero_DHEC: enterococcus bacteria from water sample. measured in colony-forming units/100mL. measured by SC DHEC.
FecalColiform_DHEC: fecal coliform bacteria from water sample. measured in colony-forming units/100mL. measured by SC DHEC.
NOx_DHEC: nitrate and nitrite concenctrations
TKN_DHEC: total kjeldahl nitrogen
TN_SCECAP: total nitrogen
TP_SCECAP: total phosphorous
TOC_Water: total organic carbon in water
Chl_a_DHEC: chlorophyll-a.
