Impervious Surface Cover Metadata

BACKGROUND

Urban impervious land cover data downloaded from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for years 2001, 2006, and 2011. Rasters contain 30x30m pixels with impervious values of 0-100 based on landsat imagery (100 = most impervious). These values were averaged within every coastal watershed in SC using ArcMap 10.3's 'Zonal Statistics as Table' tool.

HUC_ID: USGS Hydrologic Unit Code identifier. 
HUC_DIGITS: Number of digits in USGS HUC. 8-digits HUCs are the largest and 14-digits are the smallest size watersheds used in this analysis.
YEAR: Year in which impervious data were released. 2001, 2006, and 2011 (most recent available dataset).
UPLAND: upland category for watershed analysis. 0 = entire watershed boundary used, 1 = watershed area minus open water, 2 = watershed area minus open water and emergent wetlands (tidal marshes). 
PRCT_IMPERV: mean value of impervious surface coverage (%) within watershed.
