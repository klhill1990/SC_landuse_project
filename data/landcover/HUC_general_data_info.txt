HUC General Data Information

BACKGROUND

HUC stands for 'Hydrologic Unit Code' which are watersheds delineated by the USGS for all of the United States. The number digits in a HUC identify the size of the watershed, in this dataset 8-digit HUCs are the largest watershed and 14-digit HUCs are the smallest watershed. HUCs are also nested within one each, so that HUCs-304020406 and 304020408 are completely contatined within the larger HUC-3040204. This dataset includes all HUCs near the South Carolina coast, with some HUCs extending into neighboring NC and GA. 

CONTENT

HUC_ID: USGS Hydrologic Unit Code identifier. 
HUC_DIGITS: Number of digits in HUC.
NAME: Common name of watershed. (note that 14-digit HUCs do not have these labels)
STATE: US state in which watershed is located. 
TOTAL_AREA: total area of watershed (meters squared)
UPLAND_1_AREA: area of watershed excluding water (meters squared)
UPLAND_2_AREA: area of watershed excluding water and tidally flooded areas (meters squared)
*see CCAP_landcover_prcts_data for more information on how these UPLAND categories were calculated.
